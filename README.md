## 🫡 GOOD DAY FELLOW SOLDIER

I'm [_altos](https://altoszin.carrd.co/), a student from University of the Philippines, Diliman.

As a student pursuing BS Computer Engineering, I deal with codes, electronics, and calculus.

If an idea comes up to my head, I start doing it on impulse,

otherwise, I won't do it.

My main focus right now is to build my skills to become a Cybersecurity Specialist;

if there comes a time you need help, ask me in any of my 3 social media platforms I particularly am active on.

## Fun Facts:
> ✺ I play a lot of games!  
> ✺ I cook, eat, and sleep.  
> ✺ I read a lot of novels, particularly digital ones.
